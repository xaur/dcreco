- The hashrate was too low and it was unprofitable to run the pool, plus there have been problems to get it listed on the popular mining dashboard (https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) to make the pool more visible
- It was the first BLAKE3 pool launched Oct 2023 https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$wuzp9-l-khpuZPZ5mdbUBXuVcEAvuc3VK-r-LgZMPvI
