- All trading activity on Bittrex Global has been [terminated](https://twitter.com/BittrexGlobal/status/1731736725393699094) in line with the shutdown plan published on [November 20th](https://twitter.com/BittrexGlobal/status/1726652430673121310) (see our previous posts [here](https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$O5m1uFn89EBt_nJWIvdSZriZVUQir19JOczNqAK0CKc) and [here](https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$TPTkBejivsFt4A1kPm50XKQ4aRoHiYHHZVbMWAQ22vE)).

- If my interpretation of chain activity is correct, the DCR amount held at Bittrex on December 4th was [~17.5K DCR](https://dcrdata.decred.org/tx/d44e9f656bc3f376ff5814b9088b6c6de2718569d532b0dae1d7aec0e0e8f51b), and it looks like withdrawals have been flowing normally.

title: Exploit of DApps using Ledger
author: bee
published_utc: 2024-01-28
tags: wallets, Ledger, security
```

- Many DApp frontends got compromised by a supply chain attack targeting Ledger users. An attacker uploaded a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit library which tricked EVM DApp users into signing transactions that drain their wallets. This was fixed in Connect Kit v1.1.8 within 40 minutes of Ledger becoming aware. The malicious code was live for ~5 hours. The exploit was limited to third party DApps which use the Connect Kit library, it did not affect the integrity of Ledger hardware or Ledger Live. \[1\]

- According to Ledger's estimate $600K worth of assets has been affected \[2\]. Ledger promised to make victims whole and disallow Blind Signing by June 2024. Claiming refunds will require ID screening and absence of "compliance flags" \[3\].

- One detail from Ledger's report highlights the growing market of malware services: *"This specific attack enabled the attacker to upload a new malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit which contained what is referred to as the Angel Drainer malware. Angel Drainer is a malware as a service that is specifically designed to craft malicious transactions that are draining wallets when signed. It's a complete infrastructure specialized on EVM chains that deploys smart contracts on demand and crafts tailored transactions in order to maximize damage."*.

- Based on the incident report talking about "EVM DApps", it is highly likely no DCR wallets were affected by the exploit. If you know any, please share in the #ecochat channel.

```

- Several reports have appeared on Twitter and crypto news about MEXC freezing accounts, seizing funds, blocking withdrawals and requiring users to do extra KYC to get their money back.

- So far the triggers seem to fall into one of the two categories: very profitable leveraged/futures trading (cases: [Vida_BWE](https://twitter.com/Vida_BWE/status/1738243103138721844), [sallpful](https://twitter.com/cryptocevo/status/1738897746705211693), [DefiSperlo](https://twitter.com/DefiSperlo/status/1738286935154856364)), and large withdrawals ([cryptonator1337](https://twitter.com/cryptonator1337/status/1738614583902757113), [rajpadalia](https://twitter.com/rajpadalia/status/1739143218514612354)). Some comments recommend [sticking to small amounts](https://twitter.com/orkun/status/1743181676325286356) and never hold a lot at the exchange.

- MEXC denied all claims in their [response](https://twitter.com/MEXC_Official/status/1738767532004434018) on Twitter and Cointelegraph \[1\]

- MEXC has had DCR trading for years, and recently DCR withdrawals have been [confirmed](https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$IuT8giVj-FhKFJDYiR2Ctfq4Ea3Qrv0TNBeL7az6WnE) to work. The ability to trade and withdraw without KYC (possibly over VPN) makes it an attractive option on the surface, and we cannot verify if these reports are true, but it is a good reminder to always do your own research and be very careful with custodial exchanges. (And tell your friends about [dex.decred.org](https://dex.decred.org/)).

- [Guarda](https://guarda.com/) has been [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1161) from the list of known-to-work [wallets at decred.org](https://decred.org/wallets/) after several users [complained](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/18s54fm/help_importing_a_private_key/) that DCR was not working in Guarda for 3 months. Prior to that, [questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuardaWallet/comments/17x2eyp/decred_not_working/) [about](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuardaWallet/comments/184pzjz/exporting_dcr/) [the issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuardaWallet/comments/18gulcw/random_mnumonicin_dcr_wallet/) on Guarda's subreddit received no answers.

- Reddit user shared a working [method](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/18s54fm/help_importing_a_private_key/kfbw3f6/) of exporting the private key from Guarda and importing it in Exodus, which helped at least two users whose DCR got stuck in Guarda.

- A person from Guarda [confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/18s54fm/help_importing_a_private_key/kf9n3pj/) that DCR is still considered a supported asset, but "We're currently addressing some issues post-Decred's network upgrade and actively working on updating our systems".

- The reported timing suggests Guarda's DCR wallet stopped working around September 2023 because they missed to upgrade to Decred [v1.8.0](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.8.0) (released June 13th, 2023) and missed the hardfork (completed [September 1st](https://dcrdata.decred.org/block/794369), 2023).

- Guarda added DCR back in [June 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8pa74w/guarda_announces_decred_is_now_on_our/). It is a multi-coin, non-custodial, closed-source wallet running on mobile, desktop, and web browsers.

title: OKX delisting privacy coins (DCR not affected yet)
author: bee

```

- OKX [announced](https://www.okx.com/help/okx-to-delist-several-spot-trading-pairs-12-29) that it is delisting several privacy coins including XMR, DASH, ZEC, and ZEN. While it does not affect DCR, the fact that OKX joins the anti-privacy-coin campaign is notable, and it is good to know how this is announced and executed at OKX.

- The delisting will be done in three stages: suspension of deposits (December 27th), delisting of trading pairs (January 4-12, 2024), and suspension of withdrawals (March 5, 2024). A fixed deadline for **withdrawals** is not very common, something users should keep in mind.

- The style of the announcement seems to be deliberately vague and careful. The title says "OKX to delist several spot *trading pairs*" but for 8 of the affected assets it is a *full delisting* along with deposits and withdrawals. Next, the delisting is justified as "In order to maintain a robust spot trading environment" and "Based on feedback from users and the OKX [Token Delisting / Hiding Guideline](https://www.okx.com/help/okx-token-delisting-hiding-guideline)". Finally, "privacy" is not mentioned in the announcement at all, but crypto news media got the message very clearly \[1, 2\].

- [OKX](https://www.okx.com/) is 4th top exchange according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges) by various metrics (including 24h volume). As of writing the DCR/USDT [market](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/decred) is still live at OKX, with the reported volume of $380K or 3.2% of all DCR volume tracked by CoinGecko.

- Indian Financial Intelligence Unit accused 9 offshore exchanges of operating illegally without properly registering and complying with local AML regulations, and requested to block their websites. The exchanges are: Binance, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Gate.io, Huobi, Kraken, KuCoin, and MEXC Global.

- FIU didn't provide a specific timeframe or consequences of not adhering to their notice \[1\], but according to CoinDesk's sources the exchanges have been given two weeks to respond. \[2\]

- DCR is traded on 5 of these exchanges so should they get blocked, accessing DCR markets from India will become more difficult.

- Both Poloniex and HTX have suspended all withdrawals in November after they got hacked on [November 10th](https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$zCDKLEuToLyZFFXCYJRkR7N1ibIoejY7v-duulWBS_w) and [November 22nd](https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$hCpiowKI9CgSZQpFZ4qyRCDlJ2iS4rE_kltBhcd-Afk) respectively. Here we are tracking their updates until DCR withdrawals are fully resumed.

- Poloniex resumed withdrawals for [several assets](https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/articles/19536894469911-Poloniex-Resumes-Deposit-and-Withdrawal-Services-for-Certain-Cryptocurrencies-via-TRON-Network) on the TRON network, but other than that DCR withdrawals were not working in December.

- HTX (Huobi) resumed withdrawals for 100+ assets but DCR was not mentioned in the 4 updates about the incident posted on their [support site](https://www.htx.com/support/en-us/). On [December 26th](https://www.htx.com/support/en-us/detail/54957915289151) HTX announced that withdrawal services are "fully resumed", but on the next day HTX user [reported](https://matrix.to/#/!lDZCzVQjFoJsXMPkvr:decred.org/$Wuw9qQRO_rI0j37PPd717bRZOyONrETudgoWTWnqnCk) in #trading that DCR withdrawals are still suspended with the UI saying something about "mainnet upgrade" and support replying "It will open gradually. Please keep updating.".

- Unsurprisingly, HTX has seen a non-trivial amount of net [outflows](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-htx-outflow-258-million-hack-november) following the resumption of withdrawal services.
