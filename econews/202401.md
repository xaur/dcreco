title: BisonPool reaches milestone of 250 tickets purchased
author: richardred, bee

```

- Bison Pool [announced](https://twitter.com/BisonPool/status/1744408989666799759) that it has now purchased 250 tickets with no missed votes so far. 

- The controversial custodial voting service allows users to benefit from staking rewards (currently [estimated](https://bisonpool.org/) at 7.88%/year) even if they don't have enough DCR for a full ticket, but participating involves sending DCR to Bison Pool and trusting them to return the DCR plus rewards.

- Bison Pool [launched](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/vyydm1/bisonpool_is_now_live/) in July 2022, so in the time it has taken to buy 250 tickets around 156,000 tickets have been bought by the whole network, meaning it has accounted for about 0.2% of voting activity in the time since it launched.

title: Proof of concept Decred services status page online, proposal published
author: richardred, bee
published_utc: 2024-02-25
tags: releases
```

- A new status page for Decred services is [online](https://is.decred.online/status/overview), produced by @peter\_zen and @jholdstock it is an initial proof of concept for a site which monitors critical Decred services so users can check for issues.

- A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/2fc8466) for funding of $3,320 has been published, this would allow for some work to finish the site and one year's hosting and maintenance costs.

- The platform uses [Uptime Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/) to monitor services like the Decred website, VSPs, Matrix and other communications servers, block explorers and network seeders. The proposal would fund improvements to the probes to allow for more detailed tracking of Decred network variables, and also configuration of internal pages and alerts that can be used to warn about things like expiring certificates. 

- Discussions: concept from 2020 [[2020-04-02](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/148), dcrweb issue [[2024-01-09](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/1163)]

- The Decred Voting Service Provider (VSP) stakey.net had 9 days of downtime starting from Jan 11, as noted in this dcrweb [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrwebapi/issues/183) created by @bee on Jan 18.

- The fix was in 1 day after the issue pinging @isuldor was created.

- The new Decred services status site now [tracks](https://is.decred.online/status/vsps) the availability of VSPs and shows this information live, which should facilitate quicker detection of VSP downtime in future.

- find exact downtime via https://github.com/bochinchero/dcrsnapcsv {richard: the daily csvs suggest it was back on jan 19, but I wouldn't link the repo as a source as it requires looking at multiple csvs to extract this information }

- [Cypherpunk Times](https://www.cypherpunktimes.com/), formerly [Decred Magazine](https://www.cypherpunktimes.com/), has completed the traffic redirecting work involved in that rebranding.

- The rebranding was approved by Decred stakeholders in a [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4d3a8fc) which was awarded with a budget of $44,000 for one year's work, back in July 2023.

- The HTTP forwarding was achieved quite quickly after the proposal was approved, but forwarding fopr HTTPS requests proved more difficult, but this has not been achieved along with redirects for specific pages, check out this [example](https://www.decredmagazine.com/how-to-dcrdex-on-raspberry-pi-with-umbrel/).

The Trezor hardware wallet team has shared disappointing news of a security breach involving a third-party support provider, this has resulted in data for approximately 66,000 customers falling into the hands of the hackers.

This misunderstanding affected users who interacted with the service since December 2021. As a result, the attackers gained access to the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of those who sought help.

To warn victims against potential phishing scams, the Trezor team decided to send emails to all of them with appropriate warnings. Since now, starting from January 17, the date of the attack, "no significant activity" on the part of hackers in this direction has yet been recorded. However, at least 41 users received messages from alleged attackers requesting sensitive information related to the wallet seed.

The developers made an important clarification that Trezor representatives "will never encourage you to perform such actions." No user assets were directly affected as a result of this incident.
