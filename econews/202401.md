title: BisonPool reaches milestone of 250 tickets purchased
author: richardred, bee

tags: staking, vsps
```

- Bison Pool [announced](https://twitter.com/BisonPool/status/1744408989666799759) that it has now purchased 250 tickets with no missed votes so far. 

- The controversial custodial voting service allows users to benefit from staking rewards (currently [estimated](https://bisonpool.org/) at 7.88%/year) even if they don't have enough DCR for a full ticket, but participating involves sending DCR to Bison Pool and trusting them to return the DCR plus rewards.

- Bison Pool [launched](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/vyydm1/bisonpool_is_now_live/) in July 2022, so in the time it has taken to buy 250 tickets around 156,000 tickets have been bought by the whole network, meaning it has accounted for about 0.2% of voting activity in the time since it launched.

title: Proof of concept Decred services status page online, proposal published
author: richardred, bee
published_utc: 2024-02-25 05:06
tags: releases
```

- A new status page for Decred services is [online](https://is.decred.online/status/overview), produced by @peter\_zen and @jholdstock it is an initial proof of concept for a site which monitors critical Decred services so users can check for issues.

- A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/2fc8466) for funding of $3,320 has been published, this would allow for some work to finish the site and one year's hosting and maintenance costs.

- The platform uses [Uptime Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/) to monitor services like the Decred website, VSPs, Matrix and other communications servers, block explorers and network seeders. The proposal would fund improvements to the probes to allow for more detailed tracking of Decred network variables, and also configuration of internal pages and alerts that can be used to warn about things like expiring certificates. 

- Discussions: concept from 2020 [[2020-04-02](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/148), dcrweb issue [[2024-01-09](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/1163)]

title: VSP stakey.net had an 8-day DNS issue, live tickets were unaffected
author: richardred, bee
published_utc: 2024-03-03 23:46
tags: vsps, incidents
```

- The website and API of Decred Voting Service Provider (VSP) Stakey.net was unavailable via the [stakey.net](https://stakey.net/) domain for about 8 days due to a DNS issue.

- The impact was limited to not accepting new tickets and not reporting status via the `stakey.net` domain. Voting wallets and users' live tickets were not affected, as shown by zero all-time [missed tickets](https://stakey.net/). Furthermore, the site and API were still available in the Tor network even when the traditional DNS was failing. Stakey.net is the only public VSP known to provide an `.onion` URL.

- The new Decred [services status site](https://is.decred.online/status/vsps) now tracks the availability of VSPs and shows this information live, which should facilitate quicker detection of VSP downtime in the future.

- [Cypherpunk Times](https://www.cypherpunktimes.com/), formerly [Decred Magazine](https://www.decredmagazine.com/), has completed the traffic redirecting work involved in that rebranding.

- The rebranding was approved by Decred stakeholders in a [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4d3a8fc) which was awarded with a budget of $44,000 for one year's work, back in July 2023.

- The HTTP forwarding was achieved quite quickly after the proposal was approved, but forwarding for HTTPS requests proved more difficult, but this has now been achieved along with redirects for specific pages, check out this [example](https://www.decredmagazine.com/how-to-dcrdex-on-raspberry-pi-with-umbrel/).

tags: wallets, Trezor, security, incidents
```

- Trezor has [disclosed](https://blog.trezor.io/trezor-security-update-stay-vigilant-against-potential-phishing-attack-bb05015a21f8) on Jan 20 an incident where the contact information of up to 66,000 users was possibly exposed.

- The unauthorized access occurred on a third-party support platform on Jan 17, hence users who interacted with Trezor's support team since December 2021 may had their data exposed. Trezor has not received a definitive confirmation or denial of this exposure but has chosen to act proactively and send email alerts to all affected users. Contact data in question was limited to email and name/nickname.

- The [anticipated](https://cointelegraph.com/news/trezor-discloses-66k-users-affected-phishing-attack) outcome was phishing attacks against those users whose data was leaked.

- While assets were not directly exposed, phishing attempts would presumably attempt to gain access to the Trezor user's funds by for example obtaining their seed phrase. There were a reported 41 incidents where users were approached directly via email by the attacker to obtain seed words.

published_utc: 2024-03-09 03:56
tags: Bison_Relay, releases
```

- Bison Relay (BR) v0.1.10 was released on Jan 17.

- This is the first release to incorporate a mobile GUI implementation which can be installed as an APK file on Android systems.

- Improvements to the GUI app include consistent font sizes, a "Reset All KX" button to prompt BR to re-exchange keys with all known users ("which should un-wedge clients in strange situations"), a "Subscribe" button to feed comments, and an "Unrestrict Battery" option for mobile which has been observed to improve message retrieval performance. It is now possible to transfer group chat ownership to another user.

- Text app (brclient) has gained a number of additional commands, such as `rescanwallet`, commands to list transactions and receipts, and some bug fixes.

- The underlying Lightning Network code has been upgraded to the [v0.5.0 release](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/releases/tag/v0.5.0), which incorporates upstream [lnd v0.13](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.13.0-beta) plus Decred-specific changes and fixes. This will improve stability and efficiency with all the core LN infrastructure utilized by Bison Relay.

- The release is accompanied by important improvements related to upcoming server policy changes, which allow to tweak restrictions such as the maximum message size (currently 1 MB).

- Full release notes and downloads can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/releases/tag/v0.1.10). It is recommended to verify the files as described in the [README](https://github.com/companyzero/bisonrelay/tree/v0.1.10#verifying-binaries).

- A new communications bridge has been [created](https://matrix.to/#/!EXHLRfaYsLJbnAfECa:decred.org/$3kG86fqEmpDP_PUKjNcBosxjrQNwl-0orBTuJ1TISCE) between the [@Decred](https://t.me/Decred) channel on Telegram and the [DCR 101](https://matrix.to/#/#101:decred.org) room on Matrix.

- The #101 room is now the easiest chat to access since users from Matrix, Discord and Telegram can post and talk to each other. When Telegram was bridged the channel had 2.3K users, joining the ~230 users on the Matrix side of the bridge and ~170 Discord users.

- Just like our Matrix-Discord bridge, the Telegram bridge is powered by [t2bot.io](https://t2bot.io/) and is running their [custom open-source fork](https://github.com/t2bot/mautrix-telegram) of [mautrix/telegram](https://github.com/mautrix/telegram). t2bot.io is kindly provided by [Travis Ralston](https://github.com/turt2live) and is supported by [donations](https://t2bot.io/donations/) (they accept fiat, BTC and ETH).

title: Binance adds DCR borrowing on Isolated Margin
author: richardred, bee
published_utc: 2024-03-17 04:01
tags: exchanges, loans, Binance
```

- Binance has [announced](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-margin-adds-dcr-more-fdusd-and-usdt-pairs-07d0c50b9bff4e92a8035d158aa94dd4) that DCR isolated margin trading support is to be added with a DCR/USDT pairing.

- The announcement was met with suspicion in #trading. One concern was the high risk of liquidations because DCR price wicks are common, while Binance has not enabled Cross Margin for DCR to make them more manageable. On top of that, the exchange technically could exploit its knowledge of traders' positions and trigger liquidations, and it would be hard to detect or prove. Another interesting detail is that DCR Isolated Margin went live almost 4 weeks ahead of the public announcement, based on the [Interest History](https://www.binance.com/en/margin/interest-history) page. The maximum leverage shown for DCR was 5x at the time of the announcement.

- Regardless of speculation, Binance itself [warns](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-isolated-margin-and-cross-margin-in-crypto-trading) that margin trading is highly risky.

- Isolated Margin trading was supported for DCR in the past, but was [stopped](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-margin-will-delist-nebl-as-a-borrowable-asset-from-cross-margin-and-dcr-nebl-xvg-from-isolated-margin-2bcaff7b39064aa8969bb509d28b90f5) in March 2023, the pairs closed down then were DCR/BTC and DCR/USDT (see our [coverage](https://matrix.to/#/!teQafvHMYpIbqLIieU:decred.org/$8r8D0ECgPgj9n0_HTh9XQ8OyiqBrjn0sXD-qQN3F0mg) of that event).

- The Cryptopower multi-coin wallet has been released on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dreacotdigital.cryptopower.mainnet) for Android and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cryptopower-wallet/id6472668308) for iOS.

- Crypto exchange features have been removed from the iOS version to fast-track the approval on App Store. As explained in the new Cryptopower development funding [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/eada888), these features triggered a lot of questions from the App Store moderators. For instance, they asked to provide licenses and permissions for the exchange services for all the countries where the app is available, and explain how KYC requirements are met. There was no such friction with Google Play.

- The Google Play app features "No data collected" and "No data shared with third parties" in the Data Safety section. Similarly, the App Store version boasts the "Data Not Collected" privacy status. It is relatively uncommon to collect absolutely no data on these proprietary platforms, compared to FOSS-focused ecosystems like [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/).
